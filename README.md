## G'day ðŸ‘‹

You can ask me anything you want I should maybe do something, Iâ€™ll go ahead and answer some questions to save some time:

- Working on my own games from time to time.
- Currently learning C++ and all the bells and whistles that come with it!
- I started programming with Minecraft by making plugins for servers then moved to making Minecraft clients and that hooked me into learning game dev and game engines.
